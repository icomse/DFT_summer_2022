Outputs from a NEB simulation in CP2K:

PROJECT-BANDXX.out - The geometry optimisation output for each replica.
PROJECT-pos-Replica_nr_XX-1.xyz - The optimisation trajectory for each replica.
PROJECT-r-XX.out - The starting point for the geometry optimisation.


To create a movie for ASE, VMD, etc.

$ for file in *-1.xyz; do tail -20 $file >> movie.xyz; done

where 20 can be replaced depending on the number of atoms in your simulation + 2
Sometimes, you can have other xyz files that contain information about forces and/or velocities. Be sure to move those to another directory first!

To get the energy profile for your reaction:

$ grep "Total energy" cp2k.out | tail -10 | awk '{print $4}'
